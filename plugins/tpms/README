TPMS - Tire Pressure Monitoring System

INTRO
=====
This plugin is a source module to support four-wheel tire pressure and temperature reading. 
Right now, it only supports the USB TPMS module available here:
http://store.mp3car.com/USB_TPMS_Version_2_20_4_Sensor_Kit_p/com-090.htm (also available 
on Amazon).

CONFIGURATION
=============
The configuration for the module is contained within the source code, so all that is required 
to run is adding the following source module to an ambd config file:
    "sources" : [
        {
            "name" : "Tpms",
            "path" : "/usr/local/lib/automotive-message-broker/tpmsplugin.so",
        }
    ],

HOW TO USE
==========
Depending on system configuration, the ambd module may need to be run as root to get access 
to the USB driver. Once loaded, the module reads data every 5 seconds for broadcasting. The 
tire pressure is in bar and the tire temperature in degrees Celsius.

KNOWN ISSUES
============
This is very much an alpha version. Things which should probably be looked at:
1) Better handling when root access is required
2) Usage of mode strings from USB module
3) Generalizing the framework somewhat more to allow usage of other modules (I am not aware 
of any others with easy USB though)
4) Pulling hardcoded configuration parameters into the ambd config file, e.g. device pids, 
which scale to use, read interval, etc.
5) Others I'm sure...


Enjoy!
